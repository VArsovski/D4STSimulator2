If doesn't work, run following commands:

node-v  [see if installed nodejs]
npm -v  [see if installed npm]              [if not, run "npm install"]
ng -h   [see if installed @angular/cli]     [npm install -g @angular/cli]

Install the angular-devkit [npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular]

If having NPM and Angular installed, google if not specific error but this should be enough:
npm install --save rxjs-compat              [install rxjs initial package]
