CONCLUSION ALTOGETHER:
[Barb has no Delayed (except Execute if counted as such), Sorc has no TBS/Buff/Debuff (which isn't much as needed), Druid has too much Setup/Disengage, but these are mostly "ground/environment effects" that can have a dual purpose. In terms of Movement, seems fair, all classes have 1 Movement-Specific skill (barb has 2 but one has to target a target), Sorc has only Teleport but it's CD isn't as high (and can use either/or of the Shapeshift abilities to avoid/delay death, Druid has only Trample but that's ok cause has a plethora of Ground-Based/Battle-Control abilities at his disposal]
