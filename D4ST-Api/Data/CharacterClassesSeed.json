    "Description": "The Barbarian is a fierce melee warrior excelling in 1 on 1 combat with the tougher ones. In order to deal with the problem of fightning multiple opponents, his [Finishers] are also/mainly [Setup]s. This 'phylosophy of combat' allows the Barbarian endure (or dominate) the battlefield in multiple '1v1 resettable executions' in succession, or remove/single-out opponents from battle. Thematically the Barbarian is a largely a close-combat (with elements of wrestling even) fighter. In order to achieve this fantasy there are abilities like 'Spike chamber' (primitive looking groundtrap), 'Bury', 'Shackle', 'Overpower', but perhaps the most attractive 'comeback' ability, the Bone-Spear (a 'specialty' of his 'old' buddy, the Necromancer)"

    "Description": "The Sorceress is a 'master of spectacles' and overall the 'maker' of a large/r-scale desctruction. Using the powerful elements of Fire, Lightning, and Ice at her disposal, the battlefield often ends up looking like an aftermath of her own creation. Combat-wise the class doesn't have as many disablers as the Barbarian (or Druid) has, but surely has the biggest impact when hitting a one. This class is the epitome of 'Master of Comboes' theme, as many abilities have a [Delayed] impact with a delay, but often surely worth the wait ([Delayed] skills accessible as early as level 1)"

    "Description": "The Druid is a very versatile fighter that can either excell from close combat or 'fire a few ' from further behind. The Finishers most of the times buff-duration-based but sometimes more destructive like the Sorc ones. Has 3 main fighting forms and 3 playstyles (Human, Werewolf and Werebear) and can switch relatively seemlesly between them. That being said, the Druid is the Master of 'Balance' in terms of ofense/defense combat but has an abundance of [Setup]s for making that happen. From AoE disables like Fissure, and AoE buffs like Eclypse, to the manipulating the whole world-wide Storm power"
